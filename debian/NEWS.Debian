dhcp3 (3.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Please note that if you are netbooting hosts and using DHCP, that you now
  need to explicitly set the "next-server" option, even if the TFTP server
  is the same server as the DHCP server.

  Refer to the upstream release notes discussion on siaddr for more details.
